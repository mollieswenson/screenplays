Title: The Chris-tastrophe

## INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

_All EIGHT FRIENDS gather in MOLLIE's living room, lounging on mismatched, colorful furniture, surrounded by OCTOPUS sculptures and drawings. A Danny Devito SHRINE peeks out from behind a corner._

### MOLLIE
Alright, ladies! It's time to plan our next group vacation! Any ideas?

### ANASTASIYA
_(excited)_
How about a yoga retreat in Bali? I heard it's fantastic for the mind, body, and soul!

### GAIL
_(munching on snacks)_
Or we could visit New Zealand, the land of hobbits and Lord of the Rings!

### HELEN
I vote for Boston. Chris Evans might be there, and I need to smell him in person!

### JESSIE
Please, no more Chris talk. The only Chris that matters is Danny Devito.

### GAIL
_(supporting JESSIE)_
Amen to that, sister!

### ROSIE
What about a Tim Burton-themed trip to a haunted house? Halloween is just around the corner.

### BROOKE
I second that! Maybe we'll find a cute ghost for me to hook up with!

_Everyone laughs except for MEL, who raises her wine glass._

### MEL
Ladies, let's go on a sophisticated wine and cheese tasting tour in France. And we can play Taco Cat Goat there too!

_GAIL suddenly jumps up, holding a CHEEZ-IT._

### GAIL
You had me at Cheez-its!

### MOLLIE
Alright, so we've got plenty of options. Let's vote!

_Everyone starts to argue about their preferences._

## INT. KITCHEN - LATER

The group has split into two teams, preparing lasagna for dinner. JESSIE carefully layers noodles, while GAIL chops vegetables.

### JESSIE
I don't get why everyone's so obsessed with these Chrises. Danny Devito is clearly superior.

### GAIL
Absolutely. Plus, Chris Pratt is the worst Chris, anyway.

### HELEN
(defensively)
Hey! Don't disrespect the Chrises like that! Chris Evans is a god among men!

### ANASTASIYA
(smiling)
You know, I think we should just agree to disagree. After all, we're all unique, just like our Chris preferences.

### MOLLIE
_(sarcastic)_
Yeah, sure. As long as we don't end up in jail for fighting over it.

_The group laughs, but JESSIE looks worried for a moment._

## INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

_The group reconvenes with lasagna, ready to cast their votes for the vacation. MOLLIE holds a ballot box._

### MOLLIE
Alright, time to cast your votes!

_As everyone places their votes, ROSIE nudges BROOKE._

### ROSIE
By the way, I'm glad you didn't ghost me on Bumble. We've got a great group here.

### BROOKE
_(smiling)_
Hey, you can thank MOLLIE for clearing that up. And besides, with friends like these, who needs sanity?

_MOLLIE shakes the ballot box, then dumps the votes onto the coffee table. They all gather around to count._

## INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

_The votes are counted, and everyone cheers._

### MOLLIE
It's official! We're going to the haunted house!

### ANASTASIYA
_(jogging in place)_
I can't wait! I'll start training for those 25-mile ghost chases right away!

### JESSIE
_(cracking her knuckles)_
I just hope there's no one there who messes with my friends. I'm ready to fight some ghosts!

_The group laughs as they start planning their haunted house adventure, excited about their strange and wacky journey ahead._

## INT. HAUNTED HOUSE - NIGHT

_The friends arrive at the Tim Burton-themed haunted house, dressed in their Halloween costumes. They admire the spooky decorations, marveling at the eerie atmosphere._

### MOLLIE
_(cackling)_
Welcome to our haunted vacation! May the cult of the octopuses protect us all!

### GAIL
You know, I've always wanted to visit a haunted house. This is a dream come true!

### BROOKE
Yeah, but if any ghosts try to mess with us, they'll have to deal with ### JESSIE first.

### JESSIE
You bet. No one messes with my friends and lives, even if they're already dead.

### ROSIE
Guys, let's get into the spirit of things. We should each tell a dark, twisted story as we explore the house.

### MEL
Fine, but we're playing Taco Cat Goat afterwards. I didn't bring my game all the way here for nothing.

_As they explore the haunted house, each friend shares their darkest story, laughing and gasping at the twisted humor._

## INT. HAUNTED HOUSE - LATER

_They reach a room that resembles a gingerbread village. Mel hesitates, visibly shaken._

### MEL
_(whispering)_
I... I can't go in there. I once massacred an entire village of gingerbread men.

### GAIL
_(snickering)_
Are you serious?

### MEL
(shaking her head)
I can't face my past!

_The group laughs and comforts Mel, eventually convincing her to join them as they continue their adventure._

## INT. HAUNTED HOUSE - FINAL ROOM

_The friends enter a dimly lit room, filled with Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, and Danny Devito lookalikes in various costumes._

### HELEN
This is incredible! They even smell like the real Chris Evans!

### GAIL
The Chris Hemsworth lookalike isn't bad either.

### JESSIE
Don't forget Danny Devito. He's the true star here.

_As the group interacts with the lookalikes, they laugh at the absurdity of their vacation._

### MOLLIE
Who would've thought we'd end up in a haunted house with our favorite celebrities?

### ANASTASIYA
I guess that's what makes our friendship so special. We're always up for a wacky adventure!

_As the friends celebrate their unique and spooky vacation, they snap photos with the lookalikes, capturing memories that they'll never forget. They leave the haunted house, knowing that they'll always have each other to share in the laughter and dark humor that life brings their way._
