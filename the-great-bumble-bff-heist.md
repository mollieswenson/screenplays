# Title: The Great Bumble BFF Heist

## INT. SECRET HIDEOUT - NIGHT

_All eight friends gather in their secret hideout, decorated with a mix of Danny Devito posters, octopus sculptures, and Chris Evans' photos. A large table with blueprints sits in the center of the room._

### MOLLIE
_(standing at the head of the table)_
Ladies, the time has come for the greatest heist of our lives. We're stealing the original Cheez-it recipe!

_Gasps and whispers of excitement fill the room._

### MEL
_(rubbing her hands together)_
Finally, we'll have an unlimited supply of the world's finest snack.

### JESSIE
I'll fight anyone who tries to stop us!

### GAIL
_(assembling a hiking backpack)_
I've got the snacks covered for our journey.

### HELEN
_(perfuming herself with Chris Evans scented spray)_
We need to look and smell our best to fool the guards.

### ANASTASIYA
_(enthusiastically)_
I've hacked the Cheez-it factory's security system. We'll have 25 minutes to get in and out!

### BROOKE
_(swearing)_
25 minutes? That's tighter than my corset at the renaissance fair.

ROSIE
_(slyly)_
I've got a few Tim Burton-inspired tricks up my sleeve to get us through.

### MOLLIE
Alright, Bumble BFFs, let's get to work.

## INT. CHEEZ-IT FACTORY - NIGHT

_The friends sneak into the factory, dressed in all-black with a hint of their unique personalities._

### MEL
_(whispering)_
Anastasiya, which way to the recipe vault?

### ANASTASIYA
_(whispering back)_
Take a left at the next corridor, then a right.

_They follow her directions, avoiding security guards and navigating the labyrinth of the factory._

ROSIE
_(disguising her voice)_
Hey, you! I heard someone trying to steal the Cheez-it recipe. You should go check it out!
_
The security guards rush off in the wrong direction._

### JESSIE
Good thinking, Rosie.

### BROOKE
_(mockingly)_
We better hurry, or I'll have to seduce another AirBnB host for a place to lay low.

### HELEN
_(whispering)_
I smell Chris Evans...

### GAIL
_(rolling her eyes)_
No, it's just my Chris Hemsworth scented candle.

### MOLLIE
Focus, ladies! We're almost there.

## INT. RECIPE VAULT - NIGHT

_The friends reach the vault and find the recipe locked in a glass case._

### MEL
_(with her squeegee)_
Stand back, everyone.

_Mel smashes the glass case, grabs the recipe, and hands it to Mollie._

### MOLLIE
We did it!

ALARMS BLARE. Security guards are closing in.

### JESSIE
Time to fight our way out!

_They fight off the guards using a combination of their unique skills: Jessie's lasagna-fueled fury, Brooke's swearing and scissor-wielding, Rosie's Tim Burton-inspired disguises, Helen's Chris Evans scented spray (blinding the guards), Gail's weirdness, Anastasiya's athleticism, and Mel's squeegee skills._
## EXT. CHEEZ-IT FACTORY - NIGHT

_They escape the factory, victorious._

### MOLLIE
Ladies, we've done it. Let's go celebrate with some Cheez-its and Danny Devito movies!

_All eight friends cheer and disappear into the night, their friendship and criminal reputation forever solidified._

**THE END**
